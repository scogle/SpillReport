A production unit had a needle valve on a choke cap suffer sand erosion to the point of failure. The compromised cap/valve allowed produced water to release from the piping. The flow was shut off to the unit to ensure there was not any further fluid loss before the cap could be replaced. The impact of the released liquid was limited to the working surface of the location and no waterway of the US were impacted.	2014-04-26T00:00:00-06:00	39.518308	-108.248709

The site was immediately shut in and the fluid from within the produced water tank was drained. Calculations from a subsequent static water level test on the tank indicate that approximately 1.5 bbls of produced water was released. Once one-calls were completed the lines were exposed from the separators and within containment. Groundwater seeped into the borings where three grab samples (HelenE1-GW01-032014, HelenE1-GW02-032014, & HelenE1-GW03-032014) were collected, along with a surface water grab sample (HelenE1-GW04-032014) from the adjacent wetland.
